**After a successful first outing, [CodeTheCity](http://codethecity.org/) returned for another weekend of social good coding.**

With this event focusing Sport and leisure projects, I worked as part of team [Sportl](http://codethecity.github.io/sportl-landing/).

The idea behind Sportl was to create an app that connects people who want to exercise with groups or individuals who enjoy the same sport.

Having taken inspiration from the [Virgin America](https://www.virginamerica.com/) flight booking process, the prototype asked the user a series of questions before returning the matching sports from their input. Technically the search functionality was built with AngularJS and the site/presentation was built using Jekyll.

</div>
*Me absolutely murdering the presentation.*
