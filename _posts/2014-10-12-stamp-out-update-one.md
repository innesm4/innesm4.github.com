**In what may be my first side project to potentially have a paying customer, [Stamp Out](http://www.stamp-out.com) is a subscription SAAS Guestlist Manager.**

I've been working on this for about a month now at weekends and have been trying to pick up any information I can regarding Bootstrapping software products along the way.

Building a Guestlist Manager is never going to attract Venture funding and it would never be my intention to try build an app that would, especially with no previous experience of creating products. 

**This is an attempt to generate [passive income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_income) so that I can get up at 11:40am, answer email for half an hour and continue drinking cocktails.**

Joking aside, I have never had any income from being able to code things bar my job and *some* consulting work and see products as an exciting future when compared with swapping hours for money.

It seems like a lot of developers are already doing this. A daily glance at [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/) shows a never ending stream of Products being shipped, inevitably leading to a software market saturation, so I need to jump on the bandwagon before that happens.

The idea for Stamp Out is simple, An easy way for event organisers to create and manage Guestlists with an equally as easy process for people to join Guestlists. 
That's about it, definitely not a game-changer but a problem solver. The aim is to remove the manual part of Guestlists Management that would normally be done by a Event organiser curating information about a guestlist from various sources and replacing that with a mobile-friendly application. 

A quick google of ["Guestlist Manager"](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=guestlist+manager&oq=guestlist+manager&aqs=chrome..69i57.2565j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8) shows plenty of competing products already in this space which is a good sign, most focus on weddings others trying to do everything under the sun. 

The most polished [Guestlist Manager](https://guestmanager.com/pricing) on the first page of Google would cost an average nightclub that has 8 events (Fri & Sat every week) a month with say a 50 person Guestlist anything between $50-100 per month. At that price it is cheaper to pay someone an hour per night/guestlist to manage it manually. Another search of ["Nightclub Software"](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=nightclub+software&oq=nightcl&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j69i61l2.2351j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8) gives plenty of results, all of which again start at around $100 per month and with a mountain of other features like inventory and table managment.

This app is aiming for a niche within a niche and to do one thing well, Guestlist Management for Nightclubs and having spoke to local nightclubs I'm encouraged to report a market for this product.
