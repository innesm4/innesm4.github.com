**When starting a project that is quite a loosely defined its extremely easy to push the deadline further and further away**

A wise man once said "If your not embarrassed by your version 1 then you shipped too late". Unfortunately, I think this project is slightly slipping from schedule and thats partly due to life getting in the way, but also partly due to me being too precious on getting everything right.

I have learnt more that I ever imagined possible from this side project on everything except coding. Project management, dealing with deadlines and the juggling act between job, social life and side-project has been very interesting. I also think techniques I have learned along the way have definitely improved my skills at work. Shout out to <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com">startupsfortherestofus.com</a> and <a href="http://bootstrapped.fm">bootstrapped.fm</a> for both educating and entertaining along the journey of trying to launch a side project. 

Heres the logo for StampOut I designed:
