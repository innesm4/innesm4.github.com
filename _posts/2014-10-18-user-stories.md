**After listening to [Greg Hoyna Kozakiewicz](https://twitter.com/pencilrebel), the Head of Design and User Research at The Scottish Government, talk at the [Northern Lights Conference](http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/), I was left in awe of the processes, practices and procedures that their development team followed. Greg talked about the some of the challenges faced during the development of the new[myscot.gov](https://alpha.mygov.scot/) website and the immense amount of thought, research and consideration that goes into designing ubiquitous user experiences for an end user.**

There was one thing in particular that stood out in the presentation. User Stories.

User stories help the collection and analysis of user research to allow a design team to make informed decisions and trigger creative concepts. A good user story should include the outcomes from personas, user journeys and information architecture. A user story should define who a user is, what they want to achieve and the motivation behind that.

*"As an editor I want to crop my images so that they are in a specific aspect ratio and when they are resized, a specific part is displayed."*

```
As a User, I want to <functionality/goal> So that <motivation/reason>
```
The science behind interface design and user experience is something that greatly interests me but have limited knowledge of this area of expertise. In my research after the event it is clear that creating a compelling User Experience is a mammoth subject area, one that would require years of knowledge to master. 

I was surprised by the amount of thought and detail that would go into the positioning of a button, the amount of reasons that could be given for or against using a specific colour and how great an effect that could have on a user. 

My typical user story experience process consists of decorating [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), before moving things around illogically. 

What was clear though during the presentation was the sheer scale of budget available to Greg's team. Images of a Â£25,000 device testing booth for every phone imaginable dwarfs the overall budget of 80% of the projects I've ever worked on. 

What doesn't require much of a budget is the fact that, every single user story could be played out on paper without having to write a line of code. I sometimes think of a feature then immediately implement it through a trial and error until I get something that works (doesn't have any obvious bugs).

That is pure insanity! If you were building a house and decided you want to create a new wall to be placed in the middle of the kitchen, the last thing you would do is put cement down (or bricks, or what every walls are made of). You would analyse if that was the right place to build a wall, study how it would impact the people already living in the house and if building this wall could cause any structural damage to the house itself.

Taking that on board I have created a starter project [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/BzqwUH1g) that I will be using in each new project. I am a massive believer in creating boilerplates and doing repetitive work only once so hopefully using this will force me to think about user stories and encourage the use of paper more during planning of features.
