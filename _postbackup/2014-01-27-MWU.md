<a href='http://makingwavesunderground.com'>Making Waves Underground</a> is a local monthly underground podcast showcasing local talent. I suppose you could say I am responsible for the "brands" identity, and the <a href='https://soundcloud.com/making-waves-underground'>podcast series</a> has gone from strength to strength since the October 2013 launch. Below are the logo iterations/changes since launch.
