<p>As the world becomes more dependent on the web, there has been a developing negative undercurrent in relation to time spent online.</p>
<p>Given that we are spending an average of 16 hours online per month, every month (2013); this also means we are spending 16 hours less in the physical world.</p>

<p>Author Sherry Turkle looked at the break down of human relationships in favour of technology in her book Alone Together, 2011. She argues that technology has replaced the necessity for face-to-face contact where people &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have time to make a phone call, so send a text message instead&rdquo;, and we as a society now prefer the technology communication option.</p>

<p>With the explosion of social media and worldwide &ldquo;smart phone&rdquo; devices in use moving passed 1bn in October 2012, the way the world converses with each other was bound to develop side-effects.</p>

<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>

<p>Before the internet, aside from having a conversation, there were two methods of reaching someone that was&rsquo;t immediately in your presence. Writing a letter or making a phone call. It&rsquo;s true the Web has allowed people to send important e-mails instantly or video call a friend on the other side of the world, but at what cost has the dependence on these mediums had on the face-to-face conversations.</p>

<p>Social media has allowed us to &ldquo;share thoughts, music and photos&rdquo; to an ever growing group of acquaintances, (average number of Facebook friends for all users in May 2013 was 229), to boost our egos and brand our own online &ldquo;personalities&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It has allowed users to be connected to so many online despite being connected in a similar way in the real world. A reason for this as Turkle argues, is that people like the idea of many relationships, but at lengths they can control with the secondary online persona allowing users to escape from the real world to be whoever they want.</p>

<p>By carrying smartphones around, this connection to the internet is now all day, every day. Before advances in mobile communication, a user would be required to sit stationary in front of a desktop computer to enter the virtual world.</p>

<p>This is now be done from any position that has 3G or Wi/Fi reception via internet enabled mobile phone or tablet. Turkle recalled a student of hers who was talking to a friend, when that friend took an incoming call on his mobile phone.</p>

<p>The student has effectively &ldquo;been placed on pause&rdquo; until that incoming call had been completed. These constant interruptions from our physical conversations to receive calls, text messages, twitter updates, e-mails, push notifications or friend requests are now accepted within society as being the new etiquette.</p>

<p><strong>Addiction</strong></p>

<p>What is slightly more worrying than the breakdown in communication affecting some is that people are becoming addicted to being online. Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is becoming a more common diagnosis for psychologists and although there is sparse definitive research on the problem, a loose definition of the term would be that excessive time spent online is interfering with daily life.</p>

<p>A recent study by the University of Swansea has shown that when heavy users of the web log off they are starting to experience similar withdrawal symptoms to that of narcotics users. One of the Professors involved in the study was quoted as saying that &ldquo;we do not know exactly what Internet addiction is, our results show that around half of the young people we studied spend so much time on the net that it has negative consequences for the rest of their lives.&rdquo; We have a neurochemical response to every ping&rdquo; and these reasons to return and go back online are having serious effects on people&#39;s wellbeing.</p>

<p>Given that this internet addiction seems to have no withdrawal in sight, it will be interesting to observe attitudes towards physical relationships in the coming years</p>
