Reached a milestone of one year at <a href='http://fifthring.com'>Fifth Ring</a> today. Looking back at what I know now when compared with when I started on this date last year is incredible.

I think being able to reflect is an important part of any job, but I see this as a requirement in the digital industry. We are constantly finding new ways to do things better and considering that a year ago I hadn't ever used or didn't understand Interfaces, Grunt, IOC Containers, Repository Patterns, SASS, AngularJS, Laravel, Craft, NPM, Ubuntu, Nginx, Git, DevOps, Cron Jobs or probably hundreds of libarys, databases or patterns, it truly is something that I have worked hard for. 

If I could change anything about the last year, then I would learn to be able to not take the laptop home every night. When you are opened to so much new exciting information it's sometimes impossible to switch off, if I continue at this rate I'll be burnt out by the time I'm 27!
